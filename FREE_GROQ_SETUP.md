## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not found"
**Solution**: Your Groq API key is already in `.env` as `GROQ_API_KEY`. No action needed!

### Issue: Rate limit exceeded
**Solution**: Groq's free tier allows:
- 30 requests/minute
- 14,400 requests/day
If you hit the limit, wait a minute or upgrade to Groq's paid tier for higher limits.

### Issue: Slow responses
**Solution**: Groq is actually the FASTEST option! If it's slow:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Groq API status: https://status.groq.com
